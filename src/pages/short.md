I received B.Sc Degree in Physics Engineering in 2015 and a M.Sc. degree in ICT for Smart Societies in 2018 with a thesis focused on designing and development of a self-configuring IoT smart-meter for monitoring the power grids and enabling novel services. Since October 2018, I joined the EDA group as a research assistant. I started my PhD in November 2019 focusing my research in the optimization of the placement of PV modules in the context of Renewable Energy Community.
